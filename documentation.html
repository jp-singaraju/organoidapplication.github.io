Version 1.2
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
1. Select all the specific functions that need to be executed. </br>
2. The buttons and features of the selected function boxes will become available. </br>
3. Go through each function box one by one (more information below). </br>
4. Follow the buttons and watch the progress bar at the bottom to determine the progress. </br>
5. Before starting a new function, wait for the progress bar to finish and a updated folder to pop-up. </br>
6. To run more operations, close the application and reopen.
</p>
<h2>Brightness/Contrast Function</h2>
<p>
1. Open the folder with either .jpg/.tif images and click to view images. </br>
2. The images will load into the box on in the middle. </br>
3. Update the brightness/contrast (if needed), then hit the update button. </br>
4. After all images have been updated to user preferences, hit process and wait for the function to finish. </br>
5. Once the function is finished, a new folder will pop-up with the new images (.../...Filtered/).
</p>
<h2>Remove Noise Function</h2>
<p>
1. Open the folder with either .jpg/.tif images. </br>
2. Hit the process button to perform the noise removal and view the progress bar for updates. </br>
3. Once the function is finished, a new folder will pop-up with the new images (.../...Noise Removed/).
</p>
<h2>Fractal Analysis Function</h2>
<p>
1. Open the folder with either .jpg/.tif images. </br>
2. Hit the process button to perform the fractal analysis calculations and view the progress bar for updates. </br>
3. Once the function is finished, a new folder will pop-up with the new images (.../...Fractal Images). </br>
4. Within this new folder, there will be the fractal images, as well as a .xlsx file with the fractal values for each image.
</p>
<h2>Area/Intensity Function</h2>
<p>
1. Open the folder with either .jpg/.tif images. </br>
2. Hit the process button to perform the area/intensity calculations and view the progress bar for updates. </br>
3. Once the function is finished, the original folder will pop-up with the original images. </br>
4. Within this original folder, there will be the original images, as well as a .xlsx file with the area/intensity calculations. </br>
5. The calculations are explained below. </br>
    Organoid Area - The pixel area that the organoid covers in the image.
    Total Image Area - The pixel area of the total image.
    Percentage of Image Covered by Organoid - The pixel area of the organoid divided by the pixel area of the total image.
    Average Organoid Intensity per Pixel - The total intensity of the organoid divided by the pixel area of the organoid.
    Organoid Area * Average Organoid Intensity per Pixel - The total intensity of the organoid.
